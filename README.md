# Rabin-Karp-algorithm-to-test-long-string
Rabin-Karp algorithm to test a long string for any of a large number of forbidden substrings.

Compiles with command line  g++ test.c 
Run with command line  ./a.out sample.txt forbidden.txt 

Project description: You create a program that has two command-line arguments, the first is the name of the file containing the long string, the second is the name of the file containing all forbidden substrings.
The file containing the forbidden substrings has in the first line two numbers, the length of each forbidden substring, followed by the number of forbidden substrings; then those forbidden substrings follow, one per line. The \n is not part of the forbidden substring. The forbidden substrings consist only of alphabetic characters.

More description of the project is included on file "Project4.pdf".
